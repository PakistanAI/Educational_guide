## Getting Started
Most of the greatest feats of AI today ([Alpha Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), [Google Search Engine](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/) and etc) are possible due to a subdomain in AI called Machine Learning. This specific domain focuses on machines teaching themselves how to do a certain task (as defined by the programmer) based on input data i.e. the machine learns from the data hence the name "Machine Learning". Due to the mathematical nature of ML this guide involves mathematical courses as well. It is strongly recommended that students complete them for a better understanding of the subject.

#### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)
Access: Audit / Financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time) / Payment   
This course can be considered as a less intensive and shorter substitute for [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](#andrew-ng-coursera).   
Advantages:
- Algorithms are explained but students are not required to code them themselves - focus is mainly on learning how to use libraries
- Python, a well used language in the data science community, is used throughout the assignments   

Disadvantages:
- No practical advice on how to approach and solve machine learning problems is given throughout the course

#### [Artificial Intelligence Planning on Open.Ed by Austin Tate and Gerhard Wickler](https://open.ed.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence-planning/)
Acces: Free
Focuses on planning in AI and provides an overview of various planning techniques. Planning in AI involves modeling the real world including agents and actions, reasoning about the effects of actions and algorithms for efficiently finding a suitable sequence of actions (plan) to achieve a task. 

Advantages:
- Great basic course that covers many planning problems and approaches 
- Short course 

Disadvantages: 
- Not very intensive, hence lacks programming exercises 



### Holistic AI Courses 
These courses present a holistic view of the field and do not focus on Machine Learning.

#### [Intro to Artificial Intelligence on Udacity by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271)
Access: Free 
This course provides an overview of many fields in AI including representation and planning, computer vision, robotics.

Advangtages: 
- Very intuitive and gentle introduction to each field with quick quizzes 
- Midterm and Final Assessments 

Disadvantages: 
- Very old course, so not well maintained, the forums show that many files required for completing the course are not available

Disadvantages: 
- Very old course, so not well maintained, the forums show that many files required for completing the course are not available

## Statistics

#### [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/)
Access: Free
A very down to earth introduction to Statistics and probability with an intuitive approach and real world examples. The book is accompanied by video lectures, most of which are by the author herself, Dr Mine Cetinkaya Rundell, and the site also has labs in R, which make it one of the most practically beneficial, and accessible courses on Statistics that we have come across.
Advantages:
- Good pedagogy, and no assumption of prior knowledge, yet pragmatic examples.
- Plenty of exercises to help home in the concepts

Disadvantages:
- Although the book covers all topics usually taught in Statistics, but the treatment is still not too in-depth. One would need to move on to more advanced course or books on the subject

#### [Probability at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home)
Access: Free   
This course delivers an entire undergraduate experience of studying at Harvard and introduces a rigorous and intuition-based introduction of probability and how it is applied.   
Advantages:
- Great insight is given into how probability exists in the real world and how it must be correctly applied to real life situations
- Exercises are provided

Disadvantages:
- Course is considered challenging by most students
- Difficult to follow the course if exercises are not attempted by students  

#### [Statistics and Probability by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
Access: Free   
For those who find [Probability at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein](#probability-at-harvard-by-joe-blitzstein) challenging Khan Academy's courses serve as a less rigorous alternative with an increased focus on intuition.   
Advantages:
- Highly conceptual videos with focus on intuition
- Exercises are provided

Disadvantages:
- Exercises are oversimplified and lack in real world applications - course does not deliver the skills required to apply concepts to real world applications

## Mathematics
Although Andrew Ng, Carlos and Emily intentionally attempt to cover up the mathematics in order to not overwhelm beginners, students must not shy away from attempting to understand these topics in order to deepen their understanding regarding the subject. As the method of teaching in mathematics within Pakistan requires great improvement, **it is strongly recommended that the following courses are taken by all participants**. One more thing to note - our focus within mathematics courses is mainly towards rigorous university courses rather than "not so rigorous" MOOC courses. This is due to the fact MOOCs tend to simplify mathematical content which leads to limited applicability of that content to real life situations. We at [Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) can't emphasis how important it is to pick the correct mathematical courses hence **we dedicated an entire file to this topic**. Read more on this [here](/mathematical_rigor.md).

#### [Linear Algebra at MIT by Gilbert Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm)

#### [Essence of linear algebra by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
Access: Free   
This Youtube playlist discusses the intuition of linear algebra from different perspectives and builds up understanding. It acts as great supplementary content to a course that a student is already currently doing in linear algebra.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning (DL) is recongnised as a subdomain of ML and a wide majority of all modern applications of AI lie within this specific domain. DL can be considered as an extension of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) where the architecture of the neural network is tweaked. The greatest benefit of DL is that it eliminates the need of feature engineering as required in ML with the unfortunate drawback that increased computing power and more data is required. Most of today's computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) is based entirely on DL. An understanding of ML is highly recommended before attempting DL courses.
